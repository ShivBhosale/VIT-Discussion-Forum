# VIT Discussion Forum

Created a basic prototype for a discussion forum in PHP in a team of 4 students. The functionalities included login, registration, remember me, threads, nested comments etc.

## Getting Started

Install git (http://git-scm.com/) onto your system. Then run a clone:

```
https://github.com/ShivBhosale/VIT-Discussion-Forum.git
```

This will download the Ontology Search Engine Source Code.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to use the forum and how to install them

1) Xampp

```
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
```

### Installing

- Move the FORUM source code /htdocs/ in Xampp folder and start the xampp control panel and start MySQL server
- Open PHPMyAdmin and create a new database by the name "forum" and import the forum.sql file from /FORUM/forum.sql
- You are now all set to use the forum

## Running the tests

Go to:

```
localhost/FORUM
```
and you shall see the home page.

Register with a new username and begin using the forum.
The user can avail functionalities like: Create new topic, Create new Subject, Add reply, Upvote comment, delete comment etc.
